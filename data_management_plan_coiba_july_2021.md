# Data Management Plan for Coiba National Park (July 2021)

## Licenses/Permission 
We currently have permits to do fieldwork issued by MINAE (including Zoe, who we just got added on an addendum). We do not touch animals, so do not need animal permits. 

For export permits, we will collect DNA samples, but wait until Spring 2021 to ship them on a future permit. Hair does need CITES permit, and we have gotten German Imports done via Sophie Kaube at MPI-EvAN.

## Data Ownership
Data will be owned by the MPIAB and Brendan Barrett. Camera trap data will also be shared with Chuck Stewart om Renasseler Polytechnical Institute and his graduate students, and shared with Tamara Dogandzic (MPI EvAN) and Meredith Carlson and Nicolas Zwyns. MC, MZ, and TD also have access to Tool Data Linda Vigilant of MPI-EvAN and Jessica-Lynch Alfaro will have access to genetic data, as they will do sequencing. BB intends to publicly release camera trap data annually to a repository for biodiversity purposes.

## Data Collection

### Camera Trap Data
Camera Trap data is collected on Reconyx still and video cameras on SD cards. Old cards from the previous trip get collected each deployment (i.e. this trip we will collect, hopefully. cameras deployed in Feb 2020), and get backed up to an External Hard Drive and Laptop. These consist of JPG files and MP4 files. Data gets backed up to Server upon return to Konstanz.

Camera Trap Data will be 1. at anvils, 2. in a grid on the west coast of jicaron, 3. time-lapsed on beach (every minute between 0500 and 1900.

###  Camera Trap Metadata
Information about camera trap location and deployments, is collected using a form in ODK Collect. It is also done by collaborators using notebooks, and later will get photographed and transcribed, if that is required. Data gets backed up to ODK server, [GitHub](https://github.com/bjbarrett/camtrap_coiba), and Locally.

Grid camera traps will be 10 seconds day and night on Hyperfire. Videos at Anvils will be 1 minute long, each. Hyperfires sequences at anvils will get extended to Rapidfire for 30 photos. T

###  Stone Tool Data
Data on tool dimensions, photos, and locations are collected in and ODK collect form. Paper is a backup in case devices malfunction. Data gets backed up to ODK server, GitHub, and Locally.

###  DNA samples
Fecal samples (about 5mL) are collected in 15 mL Falcon tubes containing 5 mL of RNALater. These get wrapped in Parafilm, and labeled with a sharpie, They and stored at room temperature at BCI until Export permit is ready.

 Hair samples are collected using quail egg baited hair traps with double sided tape. They get removed with tweezers and stored in an envelope at BCI.

###  Isotope Samples
A colleagues project. These get collected and store in Panama. Hopefully we can analyze them locally, instead of exporting them.

###  Data on Anvil Excavation
This will be collected in a Notebook by M Carlson, We will photograph Notebook as to have a back up. Brendan will get more details.

### Stone Tools
Brendan will bring up to 20 hammerstones back to Germany to ship to Leipzig for 3D scanning. There are no rules about transporting rocks.

###  Field Notes
BB records these in a personal notebook and audio files. He will transcribe results after trip, and put in his captains log stored here.

### GPS points
These, and tracks get taken in the field an uploaded to in reach website or collected on device. They end up [in this GitHub Repository](https://github.com/bjbarrett/camtrap_coiba).

## Data Analysis
Camera Trap Data is collected systematically, and all cameras are programmed using an SD card or Reconyx App on a PC. All scripts are version controlled fot camera trap data [in this repository](https://github.com/bjbarrett/camtrap_coiba), while tool data goes in [this repository](https://github.com/bjbarrett/coibatooldata).

Analysis codes will end up in these repositories, version controlled.

## Data Storage
All data will be backed up to Garching as soon as we return from the field. ODK data gets backed up to computer, is stored on phone, and uploaded to cloud when internet is obtained.

## Data Reporting
All data will be reported for publications (with exception of GPS coordinates). Per Publication it will be DOIed at Zenodo.org
