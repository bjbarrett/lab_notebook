# 06.09.2021

I biked to Rado and gave christian his inreach. he wants to use his private account.

# SAFETY MEETING 
## Inreach
- SMS message at night, that is OK, Question on If it gets received.
- Cell Phone is her preference
- ask meg for what info she wants and where when we are in field
- Zoe's fam messages did not arrive via phone, but did via email. follow up on this.
- Send Inreach to Eleizer 3 inreaches min
## Earthquakes
- what to do but monitor seas for roughness, or tsunamis
- Claudio says main tasks on people from mainland is to monitor things remotely.
- Seems to be a minimal concern locally
## Lightning
- on boat lightening is futile?
- what to do on land when hiking
-  *ACTION ITEM* do some some research on coastal and boat lightening safety
    - hike mornings to minimize risk, perhaps?
## Other notes
- Claudio: We need to practice first aid stuff before. reading and knowing is more important.
- Zoe: female specific safety parts (and packing list).
- need to communicate directly and openly always. what are ways to do this?
- rope for rio escondido (and ascender?)
- evacuation route from rio escondido, search for in future
- we may have new oceAN RISKS THAT WE ARE UNAWARE OF
## Communication/Safety Solution
- check in  w/ daily plan for whole group either morning of or night before
    - plans change so much in field that this needs to be revised constantly
- end of day, do *2 roses and a thorn*, or *highlight, lowlight and thing you would have done differently*
    - this might foster a culture of communicating more openly and sharing disagreements/concerns
## Floods
- Claudio says that rio escondido may not be a flooding risk, speed in concern more so than height. particularly if flowing material is coming down. Angie agrees.
- worthwhile asking Alicia in future perhaps about floods?
## Solutions
- radios and base like they had at Cayo Santiago, Perhaps Consider
- Angie suggests a floating dock [like this](https://www.ez-dock.com/product/low-profile-dock/) for moving equipment
## Action Items
- Update Safety Plan [moved to here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j3uNiFlcq90WpM65gx7zz-a_feg50vfHpZKj30ptRm8/edit?usp=sharing)
- First 2 pages can be in the field emergency reference info (plans contact info), english and spanish
- rest can be details about emergencies, first aid, etc in explicit detail
- Brendan will finish his revisions from emails and this trip and then have others read/revise/edit it
