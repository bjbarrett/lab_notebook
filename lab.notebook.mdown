# 04 February 2021, Thursday

I am going to try and start doing a lab notebook in Markdown. 
Today is the day. 
I think every day I will start by making a todo list, that I can copy/paste and manage at the end of the day and revisit on the next timestep should I be too ambitious.
For refering to files, and progress I made, if I really want to be ambitionus about code, I can refer to other .Rmd documents or R scripts. 
For this to be a living document I can refer to the actual commit number. 
This document can also be version controlled as it is a plain txt file. 
I will also ittalicize if I want, for example scientific names like 
**Hurrah!**

## To do list
	- adress reviewer notes/make modifications for vervet EWA paper
	- job refferal for Rebecca
	- email ZoÃ« snail paper/key s
    - ~~github repository for this jaun~~
