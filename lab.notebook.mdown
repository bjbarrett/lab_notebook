# 04 February 2021, Thursday

I am going to try and start doing a lab notebook in Markdown. 
Today is the day. 
I think every day I will start by making a todo list, that I can copy/paste and manage at the end of the day and revisit on the next timestep should I be too ambitious.
For referring to files, and progress I made, if I really want to be ambitious about code, I can refer to other `.Rmd` documents or `.R` scripts. 
For this to be a living document I can refer to the actual commit number. 
This document can also be version controlled as it is a plain `.txt` file. 
**Hurrah!**

## To do list
1. address reviewer notes/make modifications for vervet EWA paper
2. ~~job referral for Rebecca~~
3. email ZoÃ« snail paper/key
4. ~~init github repository for this jaun~~


### Scientific Reports Vervet EWA review
Main things for me to address:
* explain why overfitting ain't no thing here to reviewer 2 who was very nice about it
	* WAIC is the point
	* parameters relative to the # of observations, not parameters. we had several thousand observations.
	* varying effects help ensure
	* blurb about # parameters relative to observations and why this is only true in linear models.
* editor concern about previous experience going into a similar task. Could set attraction scores to that baseline if you have some data.
* Reviewer 1 tell them that that graph is in supplemental and info is in table XX
