Tobi was home sick on April 01, 02. Then we had Easter break, First real day working in a while.

4. Wataru feedback
5. apply for CASCB

Today I went to Rado and met with Lucy's group. We did some EWA modelling eviews.
I set up a [shared repository](https://github.com/bjbarrett/aplin_lab_ewa) for simulations and code. I need to add working stan code to work with EWA simulations. I fit a IL model to Julia's data and need to fit a freq dep model as well.

I also met with Michael and we talked throught this EWA/NBDA integration model. I think an exploration of frequency dependence, varying paypffs, and phi will be useful.

## Kristen and Kate HW conflict
Got code running for minimal and landscape models. I made their own special script for the models. I will make scripts for lions later. I am debating about canonical models. There may not be a point but fuck it , it is 2021.

Decided not to do canonical models for meow.  I finished all plots for crop conflict, except Kates maps. I need to see her rod layer to modify DAG. Need to ask Kristen about `dl$village[dl$fid==179] <- "Nyamatoke_jklol"`

I need to add the number of strategies model for crop and start plots for livestock.

I emailed Linda Vigilant. She cannot start DNA analysis let due to persoanllel limitations. I asked about what we can do to help.

## TZA stuff
I need to impuite on household size, and check for dropped cases. found out that 0 guards were being dropped as well. also follow up on layer.

## Agouti
Bugging out very badly.. Oick up here to correct this: https://www.agouti.eu/#/project/0e0508af-d3dc-4be6-9806-dbdba5ec3368/annotate/sequence/773c5750-f231-464b-b469-1a78f27a6cea

This is likely the best tidal resource. https://tablademareas.com/pa/oceano-pacifico/isla-cebaco

# 19.04.2021
## AAPA talks today
- difficult foraging, longer juvenile periods / could be modeled.
- Tell Sasha to do a ZIP, interexting to see play and grooming in same model w/in dyads.
- Play partners, dyadic behavior does that change over time.

-stimulus enhancement
-imitation/emulation
### Innovation

Experiments and Observational Studies
Captive Studies vs. Ecological Relevance
Foraging Behavior
Route Choice
Mate Choice
Predator Avoidance
Why is social learning adaptive?

### Social Learning Strategies
- define
- why are heuristics adaptive
- examples of SLS
- empirical examples

* Brendan

### Cultural Evoltiom
-features of evolution
-commonalities between genetic evolution and cultural evolution // differences
-define
-gene-culture coevolution (examples)
-multi-level selection // cooperation
-cumulative culture

## Shreya Meeting
-megadetector threshold. capuchins in stream images just this one.
-inception-nets

# 28.04.2021
## VTK lecture AM

## Wildbook Meeting
train modified version of fast R CNN, may need to tile up images
give 10 to represntative images // include 1 claudio style image
shreya analyzign time and skiil for, bring in someone else and a ML student. 
RCNN approach. 
RUn intiaial thing on training set, generalizability of models. tradeoffs of retraining on hard cases

define the training set. 
combo of classification and overlap (false positive and false negative.)
50 images 40 days
//folder structure with exiftool

## NSF funding sources
harnessing data revolution
rules of life NSF, have a grant ready this summer for that project...
convergence project  / genetics, imagery, behavior
