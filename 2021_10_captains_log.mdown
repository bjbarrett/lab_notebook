 ## [DMP summary](https://github.com/livingingroups/ods_wiki/wiki/data_management_plan_and_data_catalog_entry_form)
 
 # Data Management Workflow

## Before 

Before researchers go out into the field they have to create a **data management plan** and fill out a **data catalogue entry form**. This needs to get emailed to and approved by Angie before field work. The DMP includes all of the info that will go into the DCEF, but the DCEF is a `yaml` that will allow us to search across years of data, and create a database of all the Garching Data Pallette/Uploads easily. In theory, researchers could save their DMP as a `.yaml` using the DCEF tool and just have one file.

### Data Management Plan (DMP)
For the Data Management Plan, researchers should record:
- What data do you plan to collect 
    - Give details on the kind of data: for example numeric (databases, spreadsheets), image, audio, video, and/or mixed media. 
- How will the data be organized 
    - what is structure of folder system?
    - How will files be named?
    - if data is in a spreadsheet, where will the **datatable metadata** `.txt` or `.md` file be stored and what does each column include/mean (this can also be saved for after data collection but some initial thought should be given before hand)
    (i.e. what is the structure and how will the files be named and indexed)
- Where you will store your data while in the field (e.g. hard drives)
- How you will back up your data in the field (you must store your data in at least 2 places e.g. separate hard drives stored in different locations)
- Plan for how often / at what point you will transfer + backup data
- Ensure that you have the equipment required to transfer and store your data while in the field

This data management plan should also include all the info that goes into a standalone data catalog entry form, or the initial data catalog entry from `.yaml` can be drafted at this time and included with the DMP.

### Data Catalog Entry Form (DCEF)
This Data Catalog entry form will eventually be formatted to a `yaml` to be sent to Garching. 
Researchers can create/store this info however they want, but creating a `yaml` using our website/Shiny app and updating it in the future will save them time in our department's workflow. I strongly recommend this from the beginning if possible.

Data that should be (propsed, but we need to decide) are recorded in the data catalog entry form are:

1. Project Name (`proj_name`)
    Projects should have a unique project id associated with them. This could/should be the name on the server folders. We might want to make this a selection from the dropdown menu.

2. People (`person`)
For each person we should have:
    1. Name
    2. Institution 
    3. Email
    4. Role 
        1. PI
        2. Collaborators
        3. HIWIs
        4. Field Assistants 
        5. Lab Assistant 
        6. Analyst
    5. Dates in Field
    *It might be worth considering having a website, twitter, email or other means of contact as institutions change or if working with folks locally (i.e. WhatsApp or Address)*

3. Locations (`location`)
    1. Country
    2. State/Province/Region
    3. Name of protected area if applicable
    4. name of research station if applicable
    4. Lat/Long (need to decide on a format)

4. Species (`species`)
    1. common name in English
    2. local name at field site
    3. Scientific name (*Genus species*)

5. File types (`file_types`)
    1. .txt
    2. .csv
    3. .md
    4. .yaml
    5. .json
    6. .gpx
    7. .tiff (or other spatial formats)
    8. .mp4 (or other video formats)
    9. .mp3 (or other audio formats)
    10. .pdf (i.e. scans)
    11. .tex

5. Data Description (`data_description`)
    1. Behavioral (focal follows, scans, etc., annotations)
    2. Movement (gps collar, telemetry data, accelerometer)
    3. Vocalizations
    4. Ecological (i.e. species, plant surveys, soil samples)
    5. Climatic 
    6. Camera Trap
    7. Spatial (i.e. GPS)
    8. Drone Imagery
    9. DNA_samples
    10. Tissue_smaples

6. Dates (`dates`)
    1. Field Trip Duration
    2. Data Collection Duration
    3. Project Duration
    
7. Funding sources
    1. Grants and Fellowships that contributed to paying for this project or giving researchers salaries.   

8. Intellectual property
    1. Data owner(s)
    2. Stakeholders
    3. Creative commons liscence
    4. Embargo and justification

9. Tools
    1. list of special tools/hardware needed to collect data
    2. list of special software needed to open/access data

10. Research Overview
    1. research area focus (i.e. movement ecology, bioacoustics, social learning, physiology)
    2. intended audience
    3. general goals (a few sentence summary of project goals)

11. Data Management
    1. Backups (text describing this process and their location)
    2. Secondary storage sites
    3. Version comtrol  (i.e. if code used to clean process data or stored in repos, give link to commit)

12. Data narrative
    1. Any Additional information that will help you understand the data. Free text entry that could be linked to above

## BJB to do-- add a timestamp of creation automajically to DCEF in shiny app


## During Data Collection
DMP and DCEF updated if necessarey. Data is contasntly backed up.

## After Data Collection
As soon as possible after you return from the field (e.g. your first day back in the office), you should deposit your raw data (in whatever form it is upon your arrival) onto the EAS data server. This should be done at the same time as filling out post-travel paperwork (for reimbursements) and returning / storing equipment. 

#### Process of Initial Data Dump:

1. Upload all of your data into a single folder inside `/EAS_shared/project_folder/working/UPLOADS/` on the server. The name of the folder should be your project name. The data will only be here temporarily while you are organizing it.
2. Update the Data Catalog Entry form to what will be sent to Garching with the packet of field data
3. In an overview/admin folder the DMP, DCEF, and any other important documents (i.e. `.txt` files explaining datatable metadata) should get depositef
3. Let Angie know that this has been updated and share with her the path on the server, and she can access the Data Catalog Entry Form. Angie will check over it, then initiate the process of initial data deposit and let you know when it is completed. Angie will store these Once completed, your data is backed up and you can begin the process of organizing it (without worrying about messing it up, as the raw data will always be recoverable!). 

**Note:** If you have data from multiple projects, you can store them in multiple folders and provide a separate Data Catalog Entry Form for each project.

### Behind the scenes:
1. Angie checks for completeness of metadata, passes metadata sheet and path to folder to Andreas
2. Andreas archives folder to Garching. Makes note of ZFS dataset and adds this to metadata sheet.
3. Andreas uploads metadata document to a version controlled metadata library (e.g. Github repository).

##### A similar process can occur for organized data, which we will update later

### Discussion
#### How will we teach the course?
Mondays is discussion part, Thursday Homework part (in most cases).
**Theory:**
- Each group prepares a **short presention (max. 15 minutes**; there is one group per section of the book) on the topic of each chapter/section. Then presents this summary to the whole group. Also include discussion points about comprehension of the topic and general things (e.g., skills learned, how is that different from what you learned? Philosophy of science).
- **Breakout rooms (45 - 60 minutes) for discussion**: students/doctoral researchers vs. post-phd. Ideally, one knowledgeable person per room. Brandon and Urs join the student rooms. If people are done before time is up, they can work on homework together.
- **Come together for open questions (around 15 minutes).**
**Practical/homework part**
- **One group presents solutions (up to 30 minutes)**
- **Breakout rooms**: compare own solutions with the provided solutions (**30 minutes**)
- **Get back together** for questions and missing solutions.
- Make sure if group was not able to get all solutions, that it still works out.
- If people want to use another language than R, build separatre groups?
#### 1st Meeting*
- Intro: what is our motivation to organize this course.
- Present results of survey about skills
- What people want to get out of the class?
- Introduction round in breakout rooms
- Short presentation chapter 1 with questions, e.g., how does this compare to your previous training? Discussioin in breakout rooms. Then share with larger class.

# Data Management Workflow

## Before 

Before researchers go out into the field they have to create a **data management plan** and fill out a **data catalogue entry form**. This needs to get emailed to and approved by Angie before field work. The DMP includes all of the info that will go into the DCEF, but the DCEF is a `yaml` that will allow us to search across years of data, and create a database of all the Garching Data Pallette/Uploads easily. In theory, researchers could save their DMP as a `.yaml` using the DCEF tool and just have one file.

### Data Management Plan (DMP)
For the Data Management Plan, researchers should record:
- What data do you plan to collect 
    - Give details on the kind of data: for example numeric (databases, spreadsheets), image, audio, video, and/or mixed media. 
- How will the data be organized 
    - what is structure of folder system?
    - How will files be named?
    - if data is in a spreadsheet, where will the **datatable metadata** `.txt` or `.md` file be stored and what does each column include/mean (this can also be saved for after data collection but some initial thought should be given before hand)
    (i.e. what is the structure and how will the files be named and indexed)
- Where you will store your data while in the field (e.g. hard drives)
- How you will back up your data in the field (you must store your data in at least 2 places e.g. separate hard drives stored in different locations)
- Plan for how often / at what point you will transfer + backup data
- Ensure that you have the equipment required to transfer and store your data while in the field

This data management plan should also include all the info that goes into a standalone data catalog entry form, or the initial data catalog entry from `.yaml` can be drafted at this time and included with the DMP.

### Data Catalog Entry Form (DCEF)
