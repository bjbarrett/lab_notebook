## HW conflict
- I added slope, and removed the question mark direct causal arrows.
- We should break up C2070/70
- ask kristen which roads she crated
- if road is proxy for human distubance, it wou;f nr a consequence of that. wjhich directy affectd conf;lict. and other things. lets ignore for now.
- did DAGs for Kristin's crop stuff too, but we need to chat

## Proc B review as stats reviewer bat snifferz
- line 103 "iinfructescences (“fruit” hereafter) samples "-- should it be infructescence samples?
- line 107-108 "We controlled VOC abundances by dividing them by the weight of the sample and hours of collection time"
	- wouldnd it be better to estimate this as a model? acount for weight as a covariate and hours as a exposure? what do you mean by control? do you have a time series of data and can you see if these get relesaed during bat foraging times?
	- line 140 to 141 Finally, we calculated the proportion in the diet of each Piper species for each Carollia species as proportionPiperX =  (positive PiperX samples)/total number of samples; check for if this raw proportion is effed up
	-  "Using the ripe fruit VOC abundance dataset and the “capscale” function from the R package194 vegan [32], we ran a constrained, redundancy (multi-dimensional scaling, MDSanalysis based 195 on Bray-Curtis distances. " is thie to run a PCA? thats what it seems like." say why.
- 253-254- if yu are going to use p-values report them
- why is diet data  Log10(percentange+1)? why is a log taken of percent? why add one your model will make shit predictions.
- table 1 confuces me, particularly with the delta AIC table

##Sloanea project
I ran some models with age/sex as a dummy variable, but I can make them better using the approach i did for ericas stuff.
1) run models with group and IL varying eff using age. just do conform first
2) add sex
One issue is that we were averaging over individuals social cues. Point estimates can be misleading. Can we instead use a probability distribution of social cues, uniqur to each individual?

I moved a bunch of things from dropbox to github, currently updating models to better syntax ala vervet. Stopped at IL model, need to remove age index variable and change to be more generalizable.

## Meredith and Tamara Meeting
Aktion Itemz
- Beign [here at seq 358](https://www.agouti.eu/#/project/0e0508af-d3dc-4be6-9806-dbdba5ec3368/annotate/sequence/ce7cbcf0-9f12-4bf9-ab85-46a9d7cda916) to double check tool number. We will all go forward and then re-id tools
- for tools that fracture, the parent tool that is larger will retain the number. The smaller "tool" if it is uesd or not, will get a new number. in the comments when the tool appears make a note what it fractured off of.
- think about AI and tool recongition for future
- going forward, we can pick a sequence to jointly ID. Brendan suggests Cebus-02-01-R1 in Agouti for Brendan and Meredith to jointly score. WE can then see how it goes on two folks scoring the same sequence.

## Lab Meeting

### Kat Proposal
1) intergroup encounters
2) iodine consumption
3) foragingstrategies
5_ wanmba and kokolopori- tolerant, prolonged associations, no severe injuries

LuiKotal- highly tolerant to agressive, few prolonged associations, severe injuries 2 infanticide cases

1) what facors predict occurence of an IGE
h1)large grups cpmpete mpre // asymetery 
h2) high fuit abundance helps offser energetic costs/ food abundance increases less ig
h3) ig encounters provide opportunities to gather social info/ more ige with potential immigrants
h4) ice between the are risky/ lesscommon in overlap
h5) females with infant avoid IGE / IGE less likely to occur as # females with infants increates

Ch1) numeruica advantege, small grop vs large group likelihood of dispersal// concerns abour measurement
for question 2 think about causal relationship between group size outcomes and # males and females

Ch2 Iodiine-

is iodine nutritionally constrainnig for chimps
sea food is a constraint for humans, common in tropics, awy from coast
kat wants to make an iodine map/rainfall

Does it need to be a net cost, or relative slower intake compared to other available options

- Created a sex il and cue file, doing analysis on a subset of individuals for speed reasons
- need to make no group models VE to see if it helps with speed
1) age x sex cue model, freq model, globsl model
2) sex freq model
3) see if i can just estimate params for all individuals
4) in future make a vector of initial attraction scores for each group per year tio initialize timesteps. this can be group mean

## niche differentioation review notes Webb et al

The stats are highly improved. Thanks for taking my suggestions seriously. Hopefully you found it improved the paper, and you learned some things! And thanks for the code repository RmD file. There was not data in there as it was directed to read data from your laptop hard drive (i.e. rotationTable <- as.data.frame(read.csv("~/Desktop/Manuscripts/Submitted/NicheDifferentiation/SupportingDocs/rotationDate16_17.csv")), so you might want to consider reuploading all of that to this github repository, and having someone else see if they can reproduce it on a different machine. The crate a DOI for it on something like Zenodo or Dryad. 
One suggestion for graphs: 
Axes on figure 3a and 4a should be revised. they are way too wide of a range, and would be made better if range was restricted or width of x axis was larger/"embiggend".
Generally figure 3b and 4b are great ways to visualize the results of these models, and these interactions in particular. Its hard to interpret parameters in interaction models, and significance of a single parameter is not informative about the total effect size when predicting.
A thing to think about. There could be problems with detecting individuals in the upper canopy. There might be bias towards detecting larger individuals and definitely a seasonal effect with detection due to leaf biomass. Data is likely not missing at random, which makes valid inference challenging. , but it depends on exact nature of sampling regime. I imagine point samples during/at the end of focal follows might be less biased than scan samples for this.
It seems like you fruit ground models within the large SE could not be estimated using a frequentist approach, and it is good you did not interpret them. It you are curious what the result would be if the models converged it is somewhat straight forward to do in rSTAN. I have old code for this in a paper repository here for data where we had a lot of zeros (innovation rates per year per individual) at Lomas. I could fit it for you if you are curious in the future. Just let me know. https://github.com/bjbarrett/cebusinnovation2017/blob/master/innovation_map2stan_fits_git.r
Also in my original comments on MS, I had (one of many) typos where i said something about "a more clever approach"  when I meant " a more clearer approach." I just wanted to clarify and not come off as too pompous.
Cool paper, and carefully thought out. I'll cite it in the future.

## Coiba map

I started making Coiba master map, and I need to trim some tracks. its in tool repo.

 note-- converting track points to lines was very much a pain in the ass but it seemed to be related to projections

# Proc-B Review

I was primarily brought in as an outside statistical reviewer, but I would like to note that I think this is an interesting paper and is an important contribution to the literature, particularly as someone who works in the same/similar ecosystems and is familiar with Piper and Phyllostomid bats. I can tell alot of work went into to field and lab components. I dp hae a few questions about stats, and some recommendations.
N of plamt species varies alot. 

VOC abundances: 
In the methods described beginning on line 93 were VOCs collected run on each infructesence, or were all infuctesences combined before being run through GCMS? 
I have some concerns about variability between samples, and whether or not species for where there are only 1 or a few samples can give reliable VOC cues.
If samples were run on individual infructesences, it might be worthwhile to know what the varaiblity beteen infructesences of a single species (i.e. Piper_colonense, Piper_peltatum, Piper_reticulatum, Piper_sanctifelicis) and if that can inform us if we can trust data from a single infructescense. If not, perhaps it should be mentioned as a possible limitation of study in discussion (for certain species). 

On line 139-140 it says how the proportion in the diet of each piper species, for each carolla species was calculated. It seems as if that for each species, the number of fecal samples contatinng a particualr piper species was summed up and diveded by the total number of fecal samples collected per species.

41 males and 24 non-lcatating adult females?

I cannot provide feedback on the quality of the trees an phylogenetic reconstructions described in lines 176-190 as I have only dabbled in Bayeian phylogetic regression, but hopefully other reviewers can.  MDS function to see how how things (VOCs?) clustered together. Does clustering show a phylogenetic symbol, when using 3 continuous trait evolution models?
line 206-207: "Phylogenetic regressions are typically used"- I assume you mean to investigate reciporical relationships petween VOC traits and consumption. And I think you mean that errore in the covariates (i.e. MDS axis and the proportion of poops caontaining seeds)
